# Philosophers
Collecting workspace information# Philosophers Project Guide

The Philosophers project is based on the classic dining philosophers problem in computer science. It's about managing resources (forks) and synchronization between threads (philosophers).

## Understanding the Problem

1. Several philosophers sit around a circular table with a bowl of spaghetti in the middle
2. Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating
3. To eat, a philosopher needs two forks (one from each side)
4. Forks are limited - there's only one fork between each pair of philosophers
5. When a philosopher finishes eating, they put the forks back and start thinking
6. If a philosopher doesn't eat for too long, they die
7. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies or when all philosophers have eaten enough

## Project Steps

1. **Parse and validate arguments**:
   - Number of philosophers
   - Time to die (in milliseconds)
   - Time to eat (in milliseconds)
   - Time to sleep (in milliseconds)
   - Optional: number of times each philosopher must eat

2. **Initialize data structures**:
   - Create philosophers
   - Create mutexes for forks
   - Initialize timers and counters

3. **Create threads**:
   - Each philosopher will be a thread
   - Create a monitoring thread to check if philosophers die

4. **Implement philosopher behavior**:
   - Take forks (resource allocation)
   - Eat (and reset death timer)
   - Sleep
   - Think
   - Repeat

5. **Handle synchronization**:
   - Prevent deadlocks (philosophers trying to grab forks simultaneously)
   - Ensure mutual exclusion for forks
   - Track eating/sleeping/thinking times

6. **Implement monitoring**:
   - Check if any philosopher has died
   - Track how many times each philosopher has eaten
   - Stop the simulation if needed

7. **Clean up resources**:
   - Join all threads
   - Destroy mutexes
   - Free allocated memory

## Tips
- Use mutexes (pthread_mutex_t) to represent forks
- Use gettimeofday() to track time
- Consider having even-numbered philosophers reach for their right fork first
- Make sure your code handles edge cases (e.g., only one philosopher)

Remember, this is about concurrent programming, thread synchronization, and resource management - core concepts in operating systems.
